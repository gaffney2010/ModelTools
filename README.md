# ModelTools
Included is a set of Python tools to do basic data and model analysis. These tools are broken up into two main pieces, exploratory data analysis and model comparison/selection. The exploratory data analysis component has tools to analyze the distributions of your variables and correlations among them. The model comparison tools include univariate analysis, model comparison, and variable selection. Note: this is still in development and the code has not been thoroughly tested. Unit tests still need to be built.
# Usage
There are two notebooks included to demonstrate typical usage. There is one example of classification and one of regression. The data sets can be downloaded from Kaggle, [classification] (https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data) and [regression] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). A .yml file is included for any dependencies.
